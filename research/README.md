# WraithVector — Agentic Security

This repository contains WraithVector’s technical guide on agentic AI security:
threat models, runtime governance, and decision-level control for LLM agents.

The guide focuses on agent-native risks beyond prompt injection:
tool misuse, memory poisoning, auto-escalation, and policy enforcement.

Empirical validation and experiments will be published under /research.
